# csharp-number-analyzer
# Number Analyzer (C#)

A simple C# console application that analyzes a user-provided integer and determines:

- Whether the number is positive, negative, or neutral
- Whether the number is even or odd

## Concepts Used
- User input handling
- Type conversion (`string` → `int`)
- Arithmetic operators (`%`)
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Conditional logic (`if / else if / else`)

## Why this project?
This project was built to strengthen logical thinking and conditional reasoning using C#.  
The focus was on understanding how multiple conditions work together rather than writing compact code.

## Example Output
Enter a number: -7
The integer is negative and odd

## Notes
- No external libraries used
- Built entirely as a console-based program
- Emphasis on clarity and correctness over optimization
